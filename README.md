# WAchatparser
a personal chat parser to query and get stats on what and how you chat with others.

An excercise to run my auto-summarizer for conversations.
input: chats in text format   (personally whatsapp conversations)

terminal/UI - request queries

can build it to command line first - like the funccat
then build UI with REACT.JS or whatever Popcorntime uses.
worst case pull up a Visual Studio WinForm and call the python script from there.
